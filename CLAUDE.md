# AGENTS.md — deepflow

Guidance for AI agents and human contributors working in this repo. This file
and `CLAUDE.md` are kept identical.

## What this is

**deepflow** is a small, focused package that adds **streaming, declarative
multi-agent workflows** to [Deep Agents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents).
An agent gets one `workflow` tool: it authors a phase/step plan in a single call,
independent steps fan out in parallel, later steps consume earlier results via
`{{step_id}}` templating, each step runs in its own isolated sub-agent, and the
whole run streams live.

- **PyPI name:** `deepflow-agents` (bare `deepflow` is owned by an unrelated
  project). **Import name:** `deepflow`. So `pip install deepflow-agents` →
  `from deepflow import create_workflow_agent`.
- **Built on top of Deep Agents, not a fork.** It uses only the public
  `deepagents` surface (`create_deep_agent`, the `middleware=` extension point)
  and inlines the few small helpers it needs — never import `deepagents` private
  (`_`-prefixed) internals.

## Layout

  _subagent.py    # decoupled helpers: state prep, result extraction, delta merge
  engine.py       # streaming executor (sync + async)
  middleware.py   # WorkflowMiddleware + the `workflow` tool + prompts
  agent.py        # create_workflow_agent (batteries-included wrapper)
  py.typed
tests/test_workflow.py   # network-free unit tests (fake sub-agents)

```

## Public API (`from deepflow import ...`)

- `create_workflow_agent(model, *, subagents=None, tools=None, backend=None, system_prompt=None, workflow_model=None, max_concurrency=None, max_steps=25, **kwargs)` — the main entry point.
- `WorkflowMiddleware` — the `AgentMiddleware` that injects the `workflow` tool; drop into any `create_deep_agent(middleware=[...])`.
- `WorkflowSpec`, `WorkflowPhase`, `WorkflowStep`, `WorkflowToolArgs`, `validate_workflow`, `render_prompt`, `plan_payload`, `CompiledSubAgent`, `WorkflowSubAgent`, `events`.

## Architecture & key behaviours

- **The workflow the model authors:** `phases: [{title, steps: [{id, subagent_type, description, prompt, depends_on}]}]`. Phases run **sequentially**; steps within a phase run **concurrently** (fan-out); a later step consumes an earlier one via `{{step_id}}` (fan-in). Validation (`validate_workflow`) rejects unknown sub-agents, forward/same-phase deps, undeclared `{{}}` refs, duplicate ids, and over-`max_steps` — returning an **actionable message to the model**, not an opaque tool error (the tool advertises a loose `list[Any]` arg schema so the engine, not the schema boundary, reports the error).
- **Sub-agent tools:** a workflow worker gets **everything the orchestrator has except the `workflow` tool** — the full Deep Agents suite (`write_todos`, filesystem tools, `execute`), the same `backend`, any `tools=` you pass, and its own `task` tool (it's a full Deep Agent). The `WorkflowMiddleware` is attached only to the orchestrator, which prevents nested workflows.
- **Streaming-first (`deepflow.events`):** the engine emits `plan` → `phase_start` → `step_start` → `step_event` → `step_done` → `phase_done` → `workflow_done` on the LangGraph **custom** stream as `{"deepflow": {...}}`. Consume with `agent.stream(..., stream_mode=["updates", "custom"])`. `step_done` fires the moment a step settles (not batched at phase end). The **async** path forwards live per-message `step_event`s from inside each running sub-agent; the **sync** path emits `step_start`/`step_done` from the tool's own thread and skips the per-message firehose.

## Gotchas (these have bitten us — keep them in mind)

1. **Thread context for callbacks/streaming.** A LangGraph stream writer and the
   parent run's callbacks/tracing (Langfuse, LangSmith) only propagate from the
   **tool's own thread**. The sync engine runs steps in a `ThreadPoolExecutor`,
   so it must capture `contextvars.copy_context()` **in the tool thread** and
   hand it to each worker via `ctx.run` — capturing it inside the worker grabs
   the worker's empty context and silently drops callbacks (a workflow then
   traces as a black-box tool span with nothing inside). See `engine.run_workflow`.
2. **No nested same-quote f-strings** in `examples/` — this repo targets Python
   3.11, where reusing the outer quote inside an f-string is a syntax error.
   Precompute the substring instead.
3. **Result-reader matches the emitter.** Event names live only in
   `deepflow.events`; results are extracted from the same final state the stream
   surfaces. If you add an event, add it there and cover it with a test.

## Dev workflow

Uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
uv sync --group dev      # install
make test                # uv run pytest -q  (no network/models needed)
make lint                # uv run ruff check .
make format              # uv run ruff format . && ruff check --fix .
```

Always run `make format` + `make lint` and ensure `make test` passes before
committing. Tests use tiny fake sub-agents exposing `invoke`/`stream`/`astream`
that yield `{"messages": [...]}` — keep new tests network-free.

## Conventions

- **Ruff** line length 150; config + per-file ignores in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Commits:** conventional-ish (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `build:`).
- **No Claude / AI attribution** in commits, PRs, or docs — author as the repo owner only.
- Keep the package **decoupled from `deepagents` internals** (inline small helpers).

## Release process (always tag + release)

1. Bump `__version__` in `src/deepflow/__init__.py`.
2. `make format && make lint && make test`.
3. `rm -rf dist && uv build && uvx twine check dist/*`.
4. `uvx twine upload dist/deepflow_agents-X.Y.Z*` (token in `~/.pypirc`).
5. **Always create the git release:** `git tag vX.Y.Z` and
   `gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "deepflow vX.Y.Z" --notes "..."` (newest gets `--latest`).
6. Push tags: `git push origin --tags`.
